    <h1> The Communist Manifesto </h1>

<h6> (1848)
    Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
    [1888 English edition, edited by Friedrich Engels]
    I. BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS
    The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.
    Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a
    word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an
    uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary
    re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
    In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society
    into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians,
    knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen,
    apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
    The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done
    away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression,
    new forms of struggle in place of the old ones. Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie,
    possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms. Society as a
    whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes, directly
    facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat….
    The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal,
    idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his
    "natural superiors," and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-
    interest, than callous "cash payment."
    It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of
    philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal
    worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless and indefeasible chartered freedoms,
    has set up that single, unconscionable freedom—Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled
    by religious and political illusions, naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.
    The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honoured and looked up to
    with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of
    science, into its paid wage labourers.
    The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has reduced the family
    relation to a mere money relation….
    Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions,
    everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All
    fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are
    swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid
    melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses,
    his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.
    The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the
    whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connexions
    everywhere.
    The bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the world-market given a cosmopolitan character
    to production and consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has
    drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-established
    national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new
    industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by
    industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the
    remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter
    of the globe. …
    The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, by the immensely
    facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilisation.
    The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all
    Chinese walls, with which it forces the barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to
    capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of
    production; it compels them to introduce what it calls civilisation into their midst, i.e., to become
    bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.
    The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities,
    has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a
    considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country
    dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the
    civilised ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West….
    In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the
    proletariat, the modern working class, developed—a class of labourers, who live only so long as
    they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These
    labourers, who must sell themselves piece-meal, are a commodity, like every other article of
    commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the
    fluctuations of the market.
    Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labour, the work of the proletarians
    has lost all individual character, and consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an
    appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily
    acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted,
    almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the
    propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its
    cost of production. In proportion therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage
    decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in
    the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working
    hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery,
    etc.
    Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory
    of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like
    soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect
    hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the
    bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the over-looker, and,
    above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism
    proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it
    is.
    The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labour, in other words, the more
    modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men superseded by that of
    women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working
    class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.
    No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far at an end, that he
    receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the
    landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.
    The lower strata of the middle class—the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, retired tradesmen
    generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants—all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly
    because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is
    carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their
    specialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is
    recruited from all classes of the population… Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of
    the ruling classes are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or are at least
    threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements
    of enlightenment and progress.
    Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolution going
    on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of society, assumes such a violent,
    glaring character, that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the
    revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier
    period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie
    goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have
    raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a
    whole….
    All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interests of
    minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the
    immense majority, in the interests of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of
    our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of
    official society being sprung into the air.
    Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at
    first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters
    with its own bourgeoisie.
    In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or
    less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out
    into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for
    the sway of the proletariat…
    II. PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS
    The immediate aim of the Communist is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties:
    formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of
    political power by the proletariat.
    The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that
    have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer. They merely
    express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a
    historical movement going on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is
    not at all a distinctive feature of Communism…
    We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally
    acquiring property as the fruit of a man's own labour, which property is alleged to be the
    groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.
    Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of the petty artisan and
    of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to
    abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still
    destroying it daily.
    Or do you mean modern bourgeois private property?
    But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that
    kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition
    of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is
    based on the antagonism of capital and wage-labour.
    In bourgeois society, living labour is but a means to increase accumulated labour. In Communist
    society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the
    labourer.
    In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in Communist society, the present
    dominates the past. In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the
    living person is dependent and has no individuality.
    And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, abolition of individuality and
    freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and
    bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.
    By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, free trade, free
    selling and buying.
    But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears also. This talk about free
    selling and buying, and all the other "brave words" of our bourgeoisie about freedom in general,
    have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered
    traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the Communistic abolition of
    buying and selling, of the bourgeois conditions of production, and of the bourgeoisie itself.
    You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in your existing society,
    private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the
    few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us,
    therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose
    existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society.
    In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. Precisely so; that is
    just what we intend.
    From the moment when labour can no longer be converted into capital, money, or rent, into a
    social power capable of being monopolised, i.e., from the moment when individual property can
    no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital, from that moment, you say
    individuality vanishes.
    You must, therefore, confess that by "individual" you mean no other person than the bourgeois,
    than the middle-class owner of property. This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and
    made impossible….
    The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degrees, all capital from the
    bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the
    proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly
    as possible.
    Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the
    rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures,
    therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the
    movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are
    unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.
    These measures will of course be different in different countries.
    Nevertheless in the most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.
    1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
    2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
    3. Abolition of all right of inheritance.
    4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
    5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State
    capital and an exclusive monopoly.
    6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.
    7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into
    cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a
    common plan.
    8. Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
    9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of the distinction
    between town and country, by a more equable distribution of the population over the country.
    10. Free education for all children in public schools.
    Abolition of children's factory labour in its present form.
    Combination of education with industrial production, &c., &c.
    When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has
    been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will
    lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is merely the organised power of
    one class for oppressing another.
    If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of
    circumstances, to organise itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling
    class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along
    with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and
    of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class….
    Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and
    political order of things.
    In all these movements they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property
    question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.
    Finally, they labour everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all
    countries.
    The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.
    They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by
    the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.
    Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.
    The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.
    They have a world to win.
